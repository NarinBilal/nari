 Write a function that stores the student number, name and age, traverses all the nodes in the list, writes all the student information on the screen and counts it.

// Function to print student information and count students
void printStudents(struct Student* head) {
    int count = 0;
    printf("Student Information:\n");
    while (head != NULL) {
        count++;
        printf("%d- %s %d %d\n", head->studentNumber, head->name, head->age, head->studentNumber + 200);
        head = head->next;
    }
    printf("Total students: %d\n", count);
}
