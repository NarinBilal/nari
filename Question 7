Write the function that prints the record with the longest name in the list.
Output : the longest name in the list: Abdurrahmangazi
Length : 15
// Function to print the record with the longest name in the list
void printLongestName(struct Student* head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        printf("No records in the list.\n");
        return;
    }

    struct Student* longestNameStudent = head;
    int maxLength = strlen(head->name);

    while (head != NULL) {
        int currentLength = strlen(head->name);
        if (currentLength > maxLength) {
            maxLength = currentLength;
            longestNameStudent = head;
        }
        head = head->next;
    }

    printf("The longest name in the list: %s\n", longestNameStudent->name);
    printf("Length: %d\n", maxLength);
}
